## 🖥️ Server Setup

To interact with the API, you need to set up the server:

1. 📂 Clone the repository:
   [server repository link](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api)
2. 📦 Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. 🚀 Run the server: `npm start`

The server provides a mock API for managing the car collection, controlling engines, and
handling race statistics.

## 📝 Project Description

This Single Page Application allows users to manage a collection of cats 🐈, operate their
engines ❤️, and view race statistics 📊. It simulates a racing competition to determine
the fastest cat.

The application features:

- 🐈‍⬛ Cat management (create, update, delete)
- 💙 Heart control (start, stop)
- 🏁 Racing simulations
- 🏆 Winners statistics

Goal - is to create an intuitive and efficient interface for cat management and racing,
along with smooth API handling. Aim to deliver a performance application that provides an
exhilarating racing experience while ensuring seamless interaction with the backend
services.

## 🌟 P.S.

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. As you can see, a lot of effort and
dedication went into creating this racing management system. It's a testament to the fact
that with persistence and hard work can achieve nice results.

However, it's important to note that the code still has room for improvement, and
Interacting with the server isn't the most optimal. There are a few subtle bugs related to
timing and parallel server requests, plus the time calculation isn't entirely accurate.
These challenges remind us that development is an ongoing process of refinement and
optimization. But there is not always enough time.
